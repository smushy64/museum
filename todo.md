# TODO
## Common
- [x] memory: block allocator
    - allocates memory in equally sized blocks
    - returns pointer to a range of blocks big enough to
        hold requested memory
- [ ] audio subsystem
- [ ] resource/asset subsystem
- [ ] entity subsystem
- [ ] physics subsystem
- [ ] graphics: immediate ui rendering
- [ ] logging: write logs to file (with timestamps?)
- [ ] input: customizeable controls
## Optimizations
## Bug fixes
- [ ] mathf: make sure atan produces good results
    - it diverges heavily outside the -1 -> 1 range
## Misc
- [ ] strings: more accurate float formatting (grisu3 or errol?)
